- cadinal wall fix (int function w/o return var receiver)
- investigation on center pixel that doesnt offset. No more answer. Maybe is the mlx put image on window
- fixed higher line in the middle of the screen (when dx or dy == 0 or in other word, when player angle % 90 == 0) (0, 90, 180, 270)
- fixed return of function find_smallest_dist. Always x00 hit even if x00 is out of bound
- fisheye fixed: the angle was in degree instead of radian. (the wave problem)
-
